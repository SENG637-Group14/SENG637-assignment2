# 1 Introduction
This report presents the black-box testing conducted by Group 14 members. We evaluated 10 methods—five each from the Range class and the DataUtilities class within the org.jfree.data package to validate the correctness and reliability of these methods.

Our approach applied structured testing techniques to ensure the system under test (SUT) behaved as expected based on the provided specifications. Through these tests, we confirmed that many functionalities performed as expected while also detecting failures and inconsistencies, revealing potential defects in the implementation.

In the following sections, we document our testing strategy, the test cases we developed, and the overall outcomes of our analysis.
